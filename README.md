Snackr is a personal nutrition manager designed to give users an alternative to the standard nutrition app model. Unlike most other nutrition apps, Snackr will not recommend extensive meal preparation, and will offer a variety of options to a user seeking to fulfill a specific nutritional requirement. The system will provide a basic framework for nutritional management in release 1.0, and further releases will feature intelligent food selection based on previous user choices, storage of the present contents of a userâ€™s kitchen, and more advanced user-facing features.
